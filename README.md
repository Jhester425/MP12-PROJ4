## 🔧 Detalles de Código

### **Frontend (HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript)**

- **HTML**:  
  The structure of the application is composed of HTML5 elements, which provides semantic meaning to the content (like `header`, `main`, `footer`, etc.). Dynamic content is added to the DOM based on user interaction, such as when searching for a city or interacting with the map.

- **CSS**:  
  The application uses custom CSS for styling, ensuring the app is responsive across various devices. Media queries are employed to adjust layout elements for different screen sizes. Map styling is particularly emphasized to ensure that the map takes the full available space on the screen.

- **Vanilla JavaScript**:  
  - **Fetching Data**: The `fetch()` function is used to interact with external APIs such as OpenStreetMap (Nominatim) and Geoapify. For example, to fetch place data from OpenStreetMap:
    ```javascript
    const fetchPlaceData = async (placeName) => {
      const response = await fetch(`https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?format=json&q=${encodeURIComponent(placeName + ', España')}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      return data;
    };
    ```
  - **Dynamic Updates**: The JavaScript code dynamically updates the content on the page, including the map markers and the list of places, based on the API response data.

### **Backend (Node.js with Express)**

- **Node.js**:  
  The backend is powered by Node.js, which serves as the runtime environment for the application.

- **Express**:  
  Express.js is used for creating the backend routes, handling incoming requests, and interacting with the MySQL database. Express handles the logic for fetching, inserting, and querying places from the database.
